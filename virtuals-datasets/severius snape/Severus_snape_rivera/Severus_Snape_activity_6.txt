1. There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class
2. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making
3. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition
4. I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses
5. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death
6. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough
7. to not pay attention
8. Our new celebrity
9. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood
10. You don't know
11. Well, let's try again
12. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar
13. And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane
14. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter
15. Turn to page 394
16. Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow
17. Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter
18. Loss of limb will not excuse you
19. Your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring
20. Gillyweed, am I correct
21. A rather rare herb, gilly-willy
22. Not something found in your everyday garden
23. Nor is this
24. Know what it is
25. Three drops of this, and you know who himself would spill his darkest secrets
26. The use of it on a student is regrettably forbidden
27. However, should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice
28. Don't lie to me
29. Gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin
30. You and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me, I'm going to find out why
31. You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen
32. Not so quick, Potter
33. You can surely survive your absence for another minute or two
34. Besides, I only wish to convey a message
35. From Professor Dumbledore
36. He asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday
37. You see, he's traveling
38. And he won't return until term resumes
39. It appears that there is a connection between the Dark Lord's mind and your own
40. Whether he is as yet aware of this connection is for the moment unclear
41. Pray he remains ignorant
42. In the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the minds of his victims, creating visions designed to torture them into madness
43. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony, only when he had them literally begging for death would he finally kill them
44. Used properly, the power of our clemency will help shield you from access or influence
45. In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind
46. You will attempt to resist
47. Let him chill him out
48. Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you at this hour
49. It's come to my attention that earlier this evening Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade
50. Now, should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression
51. Furthermore, any person found to have knowledge of these events who fails to come forward
52. will be treated as equally guilty
53. Now then, if anyone here has any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening, I invite them to step forward
54. Take out your wand
55. Take them to the posse
56. You have your mother's eyes
57. Good evening, Bellatrix
58. I think introductions are in order, don't you
59. He doesn't have the stomach
60. Just like his father
61. Let me finish him in my own way
62. A part of Voldemort lives inside him
63. So when the time comes, the boy must die
64. You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment
65. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter
66. Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the point
67. So when the time comes... ...the boy must die
68. He must die
